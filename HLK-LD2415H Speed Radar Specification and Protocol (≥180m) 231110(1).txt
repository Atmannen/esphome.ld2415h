1. Overview
HLK-LD2415H speed radar is a millimeter wave radar module integrating microstrip
antenna, radio frequency circuit and signal processing circuit, which directly outputs the
speed information of the target. It can be used for long-distance car speed measurement
up to 180 meters or more. It adopts integrated radio frequency chip, has extremely high
frequency stability and speed measurement accuracy of 1KM/h.
It is widely used in speed reminders on various roads such as highways, urban trunk
lines, city and county highways, urban and rural trunk roads, as well as road curve and
intersection warnings.

Note 1 ：0x01 is the lower limit value of the speed range 1KM/H (Factory default
is 0X01) ，If 0x01 is set, speeds less than 1km/h will not be detected and output.
；
Note 2 ： 0x00 is the angle compensation of the angle between the center of the
radar beam axis and the movement of the moved target (car) (factory default is
0x00). If 0x0a is set, the angle compensation angle is 10 degrees.；

Note 3 ： 0x05 is the configurable range of radar sensitivity setting 0x01~0x0f
(factory default is 0x05);
the smaller the sensitivity value, the higher the sensitivity, so the longer the
detection distance (poor anti-interference);
the larger the sensitivity value, the lower the sensitivity, that is, so the closer the
detection distance (strong anti-interference);
if there is interference caused by a strong radio transmitting antenna near the radar
sensor or the ripple coefficient of the radar sensor power supply is large, the
sensitivity value needs to be appropriately increased to improve the antiinterference performance. Please make your own choice based on application
conditions.

parameters

X2:Angle compensation (default is 0x00) ： Angle compensation for the angle
between the radar beam axis center and the movement of the moved target (car). If
0x0a is set, the compensation angle is 10 degrees;
X3:Sensitivity (default is 0x05) ：The setting range is 0x01~0x0f. The smaller the
sensitivity value, the higher the sensitivity, which means the farther the detection
distance (poor anti-interference). The larger the sensitivity value, the lower the
sensitivity, which means the closer the detection distance (strong anti-interference);
X4:Coming and going target detection (default is 0x00) ： 0x00 means detection
output for both coming and going targets; 0X01 means detection output for only
coming targets; 0X02 means detection output for only going targets;
X5:Number of measurable speed outputs per second (default is 0x01) ： The larger
the value, the lower the number of times the radar sensor can measure speed per
second (0X00 means outputting about 22 frames per second). Each increment of 1
increases the time by 1 times. If set to 01, 11 frames per second will be output;
X6:Speed unit (default is 0x00)：The unit of 0x00 is kilometers per hour, the unit of
6

0x01 is miles per hour; the unit of 0x02 is meters per second;
X7:Vibration anti-interference coefficient range: 0x00~0x70 (default is 0X00) ；
X8:Optocoupler pickup time: default value is 00;
X9:Minimum speed value that triggers optocoupler pickup: default valueis 00;
X0:Protocol mode (default is 0X01) ： 0X01 represents standard protocol mode,
0X02 represents customized protocol mode.

6.4 ：Command setting example:

43 46 01 03 0a 05 0d 0a

Command A Example: The minimum detection speed is 3km/h, the

angle correction is 10°, and the sensitivity is 5.
43 46 02 01 02 00 0d 0a

Command B example: Only incoming target detection is output,

and the radar speed measurement data output is about 5.5 frames per second.
The above are sample parameters. Please set the parameters according to the site conditions
during actual installation. For example, if it is set to the incoming speed and there is a speed
trigger when going, you can set the radar sensitivity. The default is 0x05 and increase
upward (the larger the value, the lower the sensitivity) until there is no abnormal speed
value.

7. Radar dedicated host computer description
7.1 The radar needs to communicate with the computer through the RS485 USB switching tool.
The positive and negative poles of the radar power supply need to be connected to a 12V DC
power supply separately. After the radar is powered on, the red and green lights will flash three
times continuously at the same time, indicating successful power on.

9.1 Recommended application scenarios:

Install it on the left or right side of the road according to the direction of the road
vehicles, as shown in the figure below, height: 1~2m; the recommended angle
between the antenna emission surface and the road is less than 10°.

9.2 Other notes:
◆This radar only detects relatively moving targets within the inspected area, and does not detect
completely stationary targets. The output result is information such as the speed of the
nearest/fastest target in relative motion within the detection area.
◆ If there are obstructions such as water or metal in the radar emission direction that strongly
reflect millimeter wave signals, the radar detection effect will be seriously affected.
